## Bongo: Asynchronous Command and Control

Bongo is a lightweight, CLI, Python-based command and control server. It communicates with targets by establishing threads on a centralized [Stikked](https://github.com/claudehohl/stikked) server. This paradigm means that targets never need to communicate directly with Bongo and that commands can be issued asynchronously between Bongo and the target.
